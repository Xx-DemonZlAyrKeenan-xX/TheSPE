      <h3>The Stanford Prison experiment took place over 40 years ago on August 15-21st, 1971. 
      Its original intention was to "Examine the psychological effects of authority and powerlessness in a prison environment."
        -<i>Stanford University.</i>
      By the end of the experiment there was another conclusion to gather. This conclusion was that evil can be brought out of an otherwise
        good person simply from the circumstances of his enviorment, without the individual even realizing they're doing anything wrong.

            <h2> The Setting </h2>
      <br>
      <h3> Stanford University is located in Santa Clara, California. The experiment was expected to run for 1-2 weeks
        over the summer when school was out. The mock prison the researchers set up was located in the basement of Jordan hall, a 
        psycology building they had acsess to. The prison would have no windows, clocks, or anything else that you could 
        identify the outside world with.

      <h2> The Doctor, and the Incentive </h2>
      <br>
      <h3> Psychology professor Philip G. Zimbardo, recruited Stanford students using a local newspaper ad. The ad promised $15 
        a day in exchange for participating in the two week study. Adjusting for inflation, $15 in 1971 equates to $94.15. Over
        the two weeks the experiment was scheduled to run, this equated to over $1300 in todays money. So naturally students 
        chose to participate. 
        Twenty-four students were carefully screened and randomly assigned into groups of prisoners and guards.
