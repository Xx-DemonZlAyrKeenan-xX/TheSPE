      <h3>The Stanford Prison experiment took place over 40 years ago on August 15-21st, 1971. 
      Its original intention was to "Examine the psychological effects of authority and powerlessness in a prison environment."
        <h4>-<i>Stanford University.</i></h4>
      By the end of the experiment there was another conclusion to gather. This conclusion was that evil can be brought out of an otherwise
        good person simply from the circumstances of his enviorment, without the individual even realizing they're doing anything wrong. 
      </h3>
            <h2> The Setting </h2>
      <h3> Stanford University is located in Santa Clara, California. The experiment was expected to run for 1-2 weeks
        over the summer when school was out. The mock prison the researchers set up was located in the basement of Jordan hall, a 
        psycology building they had acsess to. The prison would have no windows, clocks, or anything else that you could 
        identify the outside world with.

      <h2> The Doctor, and the Incentive </h2>
      <h3> Psychology professor Philip G. Zimbardo, recruited local college students using a local newspaper ad. The ad promised $15 
        a day in exchange for participating in the two week study. Adjusting for inflation, $15 in 1971 equates to $94.15. Over
        the two weeks the experiment was scheduled to run, this equated to over $1300 in todays money. So naturally these broke little college students 
        chose to participate. 
        </h3>

        <h3>
        
      "Over 70 applicants who answered our ad and were given diagnostic interviews,
      an extensive battery of psychological tests administered by Craig Haney
and Curt Banks which helped us to eliminate all of those candidates with
any kind of psychological problem, medical disability or history of
crime or drug abuse, until we were left with the final sample of 24
subjects. They were college students from allover the United States
and Canada who happened to be in the Stanford area during the summer 
and wanted to earn $15 a day by participating in a psychological study.
On all dimensions that we were able to test or to observe, they reacted
normally."<h4> -<i>Dr. Zimbardo, THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT: A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment

      <h2>The  Prisoner Experience</h2>
      <h3>After the participants were approved to participate, the police showed up at their house unannounced, and 
        arrested them the same way they would any other run of the mill felon. They fingerprinted them, and
        brought them to the mock prison blindfolded, where they would be staying. 
        <br>
        After they arrived at the prison they were <strong>stripped naked, and deloused.</strong> This was done to humiliate them,
        and make them feel insecure. From this point on they were given the "dresses" seen in the image above. They also
        wore a chain and lock around their ankle that they couldn't remove. This didn't limit their movement, it was just awkward.
        They were not allowed to refer to other prisoners by name and only by their number. They had no underclothes.
        They had no name. They wore caps, so they didn't even have a hairstyle. This was all done in the attempt to
        strip them of their personal identity and things that made them feel secure. After this they were introduced to their cells,
        which were shared with two other bunk mates. You may be asking yourself why they did this to the prisoners, and again, it was to 
        humiliate them.

      <h2>The Guard Experience</h2>
      <h3>The guards are what made this experiment infamous. They lived their role to the extreme. Picture a streyotypical 
        prison guard, now dress him in full khaki uniform, and sunglasses. The sunglasses made it where you couldn't make 
        eye contact, a crucial part in conversing with someone. The uniforms were superior in design to the prisoners,
        reinforcing the guards' superior auras. Things only got bad because of how extreme the guards were being,
        waking up prisoners at random times in the night to do "counts" (Saying their ID number hundreds of times) and 
        excercises that consisted mainly of push ups and jumping jacks. These actions were of course uncomfortable for
        the prisoners in their dresses. 
        
        <br>
        
        "When a prisoner turned over,
the chain \vould hit his other foot, waking him up and reminding him
that he was still in prison, unable to escape even in his dreams."<i>Dr. Zimbardo, THE STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT: A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment
          conducted August 1971 at Stanford University</i>
      <br>
        The guards were not allowed to hit the prisoners; However, hey did have batons.
        The Guards also established 17 rules to keep the prisoners up to their standards. 
        <a href="http://pdf.prisonexp.org/rules.pdf">Prison Rules</a>
        <br>
        All of this built an incredibly oppresive, hopeless atmosphere for the prisoners. The guards progressively got
        more twisted in their ways of showing their authority to the prisoners. Smoking, something that the prisoners were told 
        they would be able to do after meals, was quickly taken away at the guards discresion. The most infamous of the
        guards was Dave Eshelman, AKA â€œJohn Wayne." He was the most abusive guard in the simulation. Cruel and unusual punishment
        was pretty much his motto. He made the prisoners do push ups when they didn't live up to his sadistic standards. He
        threw the prisoners in a closet called solitary confinement for any reason. </h3>
